# Monkey language interperter

This is the implementation of the monkey language interpreter that is introduced in 'Writing An Interpreter In Go.' book.
Source codes were mainly implemented by the book's method. but I refactored some codes that are not fit of the golang's coding convention (Writing constant name in camelCase, using go.mod, etc...)
